# TICKETBOOKINGSYSTEM


-> Ticket Booking Application Tool [T-BAT] that allows booking of 20 users through queues. 
-> Implemented for 1 Zone having 4 Blocks with a separate Queue for each block.
-> Allocation of booking is done through randomisation at Block level (queue allocation).
-> Code use cases can be extended further by changing number of tickets, number of blocks and number of zones [Not tested and might break code]
